# Cybersecurity-Capstone-Project
Capstone project for the cybersecurity specialization, from the University of Maryland, College Park.

## Project 📋
Build a secure messaging system. Users should be able to post messages to other user, and read messages sent to them. The system must be secure so no unauthorized people should be able to read a message.

## Functionality 🔧
• Registration page where users register for the system.

• Login page, where users authenticate.

• Inbox, where users can see messages sent to them.

• Send message page allows users to send messages to other users. One user should be able to address a message to another by username.

• If a user does not remember their login information, there should be some way to reset it.

• Accessible database (/dbdump).
